  <h2>Please Note: New Pricing in effect as of 4/4/2014!</h2>
  <p><b>Main changes:</b>New quantity price break at 1,000+; lower pricing for 8x10s on Glossy (Crystal Archive) for quantities above 100; most prices for quantities below 100 went up.</p>
  <p>See the pricing page at <a href="http://qprints.com/pricing/">http://qprints.com/pricing/</a> for more info.</p>
  <br /><br />
 <p>We have 3 paper types available - all are traditional silver halide papers (not inkjet) made by Fuji.
</p><ul><li><b>Pro Luster:</b> This is Fuji's Professional paper called Fuji Super Type PD. It is a great all around paper with a thick base, deep blacks and a 
professional watermark on the back. Luster is a matte finish with a very slight 
    texture to it.</li>
    <li><b>Glossy:</b> This is Fuji's consumer paper called Fuji Crystal Archive. This is a shiny smooth surface on a slightly thinner base than the Pro Luster.</li>
    <li><b>Pearl:</b> This is Fuji's specialty paper that is a high gloss with a slight metalic sheen to it. It looks spectacular on images with saturated colors. Pearl paper is slightly
more expensive.</li></ul>

    <h2>Notes, Tips and Misc Info</h2>
    <ul><li>Our products are divided into Product Catalogs - one for each of our main paper types. You cannot order from
more than one catalog in the same order.</li>

<li>Our pricing is quantity based with breaks for over 10, 100 and over 300 prints of the same size. It does not matter if you order the same image or different images, 
as long as they are the same size print you will get the quantity price for the total number of prints.</li>
        <li>We have a $7.00 minimum, not including shipping.</li>
        <li>Our normal turnaround time is less than 24 hours - most orders received before 
            12 noon Pacific Time ship the same day.</li>
        <li>We ship via USPS Priority and Express Mail - they have been excellent to work 
            with. If you would like to use your own UPS/Fed Ex account please let us know.</li>
        <li>Having trouble ordering large quantities of different images? ROES has some 
            trouble with our way of pricing (quantity breaks for multiple images for the 
            same size) so we have created additional catalogs that do not have any pricing 
            in them (see catalog drop down on bottom left when in any catalog). These 
            catalogs work much better if you are ordering 100's of different images. You 
            will not see any pricing in ROES though.</li>
        <li>Need&nbsp; some sample prints? We have a Samples catalog that will allow you to order 
            8x10s in Pro Luster, Glossy and Pearl finishes with no minimum and a flat $5 
            shipping fee.</li>
