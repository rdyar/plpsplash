<p><em>Unofficial ROES and LabWorks forum for Photo Labs.</em></p>

<p>Forum? well, not really. Just using GitHub's "Issues" as a free forum. </p>

<p>My Name is Ron, and I own a <a href="http://prolabprints.com">Photo Lab in San Diego called ProLabPrints.com/ Fromex Photo Lab</a>. I enjoy tech stuff and helping others, and am usually frustrated that there is no user forum for ROES. I think the ROES people do an amazing job of support, but sometimes I feel like some things could be more easily done thru a forum. That said I have several better things to do than create a forum and manage users, so I figured I would try posting my issues here, and if others wish to join in great. Otherwise it may just be my own list of issues encountered for future reference.</p>

<p>If you want to join in, all you need is a GitHub account (free) and then you should be able to create an issue, or reply to an existing one.</p>

<p>"Issues" are on the right side - the little (!).</p>
